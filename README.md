# ðŸŽµ Music Genre Prediction - Decision Tree Classifier

This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** from scikit-learn to predict music genres based on user attributes like **age** and **gender**.

## ðŸ“œ Description
The model is trained on a dataset (`music.csv`) containing user information:
- `age`
- `gender` (1 for male, 0 for female)
- `genre` (target label)

After training, the model predicts the genre of music a person might like based on their age and gender.
